CRIS - CR3 Downloader
Author: Austin Transportation Department, Data and Technology Services

Description: This script allows the user to log in to the CRIS website
and download CR3 pdf files as needed. The list of CR3 files to be downloaded
is obtained from Hasura, and it is contingent to records that do not have
any CR3 files associated.
