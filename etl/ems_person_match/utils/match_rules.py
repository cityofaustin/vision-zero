"""
Hierarchical matching rules for linking EMS PCR records to CRIS people records.

Rules are applied sequentially from most to least restrictive. This ensures
high-confidence matches are made first.

Each rule specifies which attributes must match  between the
PCR and person record for the pairing to be accepted. The first rule that finds
a match wins, preventing the same person from being matched to multiple PCRs.
