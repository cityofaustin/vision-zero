# Vision Zero Database (VZD)

The Vision Zero Database (VZD) is a Postgresql database that serves as the central repository of Austin's traffic crash data. The database is fronted with a GraphQL API, powered by [Hasura](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine), which is also used to manage schema migrations.

The design supports an editing environment which enables Vision Zero program staff to edit and enrich crash data, while also allowing record updates to flow into the database from upstream sources, such as the TxDOT Crash Records Information System (CRIS).

## Data sources

### TxDOT Crash Records Information System (CRIS)

The [TxDOT Crash Record Information System](https://www.txdot.gov/data-maps/crash-reports-records/crash-data-analysis-statistics.html) (CRIS) is a statewide, automated database for traffic crashes reports.

CRIS data accounts for the vast majority of records in the database: the [Vision Zero Editor (VZE)](../editor/README.md) is designed primarily as a tool for editing and enriching data received from CRIS, and the [Vision Zero Viewer (VZV)](../viewer/README.md) is powered entirely by enriched CRIS data.

The CRIS data in our database consists of four record types:

- `crashes` - each row is single crash event, with attributes such as the crash timestamp, crash location, and manner of collision
- `units` - each row describes a unit, or vehicle, involved in a crash. Each unit relates to one crash record.
- `people` - each row describes a person involved in a crash. Each person relates to one unit.
- `charges` - each row describes a legal charge filed by the responding law enforcement agency. Each charge relates to one person. Charges have special handling and only exist in the `charges_cris`, as described in detail [below](#charges-records).

#### Design

The core challenge that the database schema solves is to preserve the integrity of staff members' edits while simultaneously allowing crash record updates to flow into the database from CRIS. The editing environment is achieved by managing multiple copies of each of the `crashes`, `units`, and `people` tables, so that CRIS edits and Vision Zero staff edits remain isolated.

For example, the `crashes` records are managed in three tables:

- `crashes_cris`: records that are created and updated by TxDOT CRIS through the [CRIS import ETL](../etl/cris_import/README.md)
- `crashes_edits`: record edits created by Vision Zero staff through the Vision Zero Editor web app
- `crashes`: a unified version of each record which combines the values in `crashes_cris` plus any values in `crashes_edits`

As pictured in the diagram below, the typical data flow for a crash record is as follows:

1. A new record is inserted into the `crashes_cris` table through the [CRIS import ETL](../etl/cris_import/README.md).
2. On insert into `crashes_cris`, an "empty" copy of the record is inserted into the `crashes_edits` table. The record is inserted into the `crashes_edits` table with null values in every column except the `id`, which has a foreign key constraint referencing the `crashes_cris.id` column.
3. At the same time, a complete copy of the record is inserted into the `crashes` table.
4. A Vision Zero Editor user may update crash records by updating rows in the `crashes_edits` table. When an update is received, a trigger function coalesces each value in the `crashes_edits` table with the corresponding value in the `crashes_cris` table. The resulting record—which contains the original CRIS-provided values plus any edit values made through user edits—is applied as an update to the corresponding record in the `crashes` table.
5. Similarly, when an existing `crashes_cris` record is updated through the CRIS import ETL, the updated record is coalesced against the corresponding row in the `crashes_edits` table, and the result is saved in the `crashes` table.
6. Finally, once a record is updated in the `crashes` table, additional trigger functions apply various business rules and enrich the row with spatial attributes based on its location. These trigger functions are reserved for values that require heavy computation—additional business rules can be applied through table views.

![CRIS editing model](../docs/images/cris_data_model.png)
_The "layered" editing environment of the Vision Zero Database_

The process for updating `units` and `people` behaves in the same manner as `crashes`. To ensure proper data flow and trigger behavior, **records should never be directly inserted into the `_edits` or unified tables**.

#### CRIS Extract configuration and accounts

The team maintains multiple CRIS login accounts to manage the delivery of CRIS data to our AWS S3 ingest bucket. See the [CRIS import ETL documentation](../etl/cris_import/README.md) for more information on how CRIS data is delivered to S3 and imported into our database.

The credentials for our CRIS logins are in the password store, including a note in the title indicating each login's purpose:

- **Production extract account**: this is the account which is configured for daily delivery of extracts to S3 production.
- **Dev/testing extract account**: this account should be used for requesting ad-hoc CRIS extracts for delivery via S3 or manual download.
- **Query & analyze account**: this account can be used for the CRIS query interface, that enables querying and access to individual crash records.

Additional information about CRIS access can be found on the [TxDOT website](https://www.txdot.gov/data-maps/crash-reports-records/crash-data-analysis-statistics.html).

Follow these steps to configure a new extract delivery:

1. Login to CRIS using the appropriate account (see above): https://cris.dot.state.tx.us/

2. From the **My Extract Requests** page, click **Add**, and follow the extract request wizard

- **Extract Type**: Standard
- **Extract Format**: CSV
- **Include CR-3 Crash Report files in Extract**: Yes (checked)

![CRIS extract config - page 1](../docs/images/extract_config_1.png)

- **Include Crash Reports From**: Specific Counties: `Hays`, `Travis`, and `Williamson`

- **Include Crash Reports From**: Process Date range
  - If you are backfilling, include a day before your target day as a buffer.
  - If you request a process date of today, the extract will not deliver until the next day.
  - To set up a recurring request, add a range of dates that ends in the future.

Any part of the range that falls in the past will be delivered in single zip that is separate from the zips that will deliver in the future. The includes - all records with process dates available including today.

Any part of the range that is in the future will create daily zips that include each day available going forward. For example, on 4/19/2024, you make a request for Process Begin Date = 01/01/2024 and Process End Date = 12/31/2024 The would receive two zips: One containing all records with process date from 01/01/2024 to 04/18/2024, and one containing all records with process date from 04/19/2024 to 04/19/2024. Going forward, you will receive one zip per day for each process date that passes

- **Extract password**: the password called `EXTRACT_PASSWORD` from Vision Zero CRIS Import 1Password item
- **Delivery**: How you want to receive it. Typically you would use the pre-configured AWS option, specifiyng the `dev`, `staging`, or `prod` inbox subdirectory. See the CRIS import ETL readme for more details.

#### CRIS data processing

We receive CRIS data from TxDOT on a nightly basis through the CRIS "automated interface", which delivers an encrypted `.zip` file to an S3 bucket on our AWS premise. The `.zip` file contains all crash records _processed_ in the last 24 hours, and includes both CSV files and crash report PDFs (aka CR3s).

At the time of writing, [this guide](https://www.txdot.gov/content/dam/docs/crash-records/cris-guide.pdf) provides an overview of how CRIS data delivery is configured.

For more details on how we ingest CRIS data into our database, see the [CRIS import ETL documentation](../etl/cris_import/README.md).

#### Lookup tables

Lookup tables for `crashes`, `units`, and `people` tables are housed in the `lookups` schema in the database. Here's what you need to know about them:

- The majority of our lookup tables are defined by CRIS and exactly match the CRIS extract schema
- Some of our lookup tables contain custom lookup values, and we have a mechanism for managing custom values alongside CRIS-provided values
- Some of our lookup tables are completely custom and do not exist in the CRIS extract
- Because we enforce foreign key constraints against all lookup table references, the CRIS import ETL will break if our lookup tables are not periodically refreshed to ensure they match the latest CRIS schema. We have a helper script to assist with that task.

See the [Common maintenance tasks](#common-maintenance-tasks) section for specific details about creating and updating lookup tables.

##### Lookup table structure and custom lookup table values

All lookup tables follow the same table structure, with the three columns:

- `id` - an integer primary key value that **is not auto-incrementing**. These ID values are defined either by `CRIS` or by our team member who implements a custom lookup value.
- `label` - the text label descriptor of the lookup value
- `source` - the entity who is the source of the lookup table value definition. should be either `cris` or, for custom values, `vz`.

In addition to the `source` column, constraint checks must be added to tables which use custom values, to ensure that CRIS-provided `id` values do not collide with custom `vz`-sourced values.

For example, consider the `lookups.injry_sev` table, which includes a custom value, `KILLED (NON-ATD)`, which is used by staff to override the CRIS-defined injury severity of a person record:

```
| id  | label                    | source |
| --- | ------------------------ | ------ |
| 0   | UNKNOWN                  | cris   |
| 1   | SUSPECTED SERIOUS INJURY | cris   |
| 2   | SUSPECTED MINOR INJURY   | cris   |
| 3   | POSSIBLE INJURY          | cris   |
| 4   | FATAL INJURY             | cris   |
| 5   | NOT INJURED              | cris   |
| 95  | AUTONOMOUS               | cris   |
| 99  | KILLED (NON-ATD)         | vz     |
```

The original migration for this table is [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/vision-zero/blob/e56e3c6bc654a21f667142ce53232bad44cff7e5/atd-vzd/migrations/default/1715960018005_lookup_table_seeds/up.sql#L11054-L11056).

Because the table has a custom value, it is configured with a check constraint ([PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS)) to ensure that future updates to this lookup table do not result in an ID collision:

```sql
"injry_sev_owner_check" CHECK (id < 99 AND source = 'cris' OR id >= 99 AND source = 'vz')
```

Any row inserted into this table must use the source `vz` if the `id` value is greater than or equal to `99`. This ensures that our lookup table helper script (todo: link) will not override our custom lookup values.

Additionally, the `people_cris` table, which references this lookup, is configured with a check constraint that prevents CRIS from using our custom value:

```sql
 "people_cris_prsn_injry_sev_id_check" CHECK (prsn_injry_sev_id < 99)
```

See the [Common maintenance tasks](#common-maintenance-tasks) section for more details about creating and updating lookup tables.

#### Charges records

Charges records are provided by CRIS and describe a legal charge filed by the responding law enforcement agency. These records require special handling in our database because CRIS does not provide a unique primary key column for charges. Here's what you should know about these records:

1. Charge records only exist in the `charges_cris` table and do not have corresponding `charges_edits` or `charges` tables.
2. During the CRIS import, all charge records are **deleted** from the database for any crash ID present in the CRIS extract. After deletion, the CRIS import ETL inserts all charges records present in the extract.
3. The CRIS import ETL filters out charge records where the `charge` value is `NO CHARGE`—this reduces the number of charge records in the database by many thousands.
4. Because charges are subject to deletion, they are not editable through the VZE/graphql API and should be considered read-only.

#### Database IDs, CRIS record IDs, and primary keys

Each of the crashes, units, cris, and charges tables uses an auto-incrementing integer column called `id` as its primary key. CRIS provides a separate set of columns which can be used to uniquely identify records, and these columns are used to match record updates provided by CRIS to their corresponding record in the database.

For clarity, the column name `crash_pk` is used on tables which reference the crash `id` column, and the column name `cris_crash_id` is used to reference the CRIS-provided ID column, `crash_id`. Prior to Vision Zero v2.0, the name `crash_id` was used universally in reference to the CRIS crash ID column.

This table outlines the primary key columns in the database and how they relate to CRIS-provided identifiers.

| Record type | Primary key column | CRIS row identifier                                  | Parent record type | Parent foreign key column name | Note                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| crashes     | `id`               | `cris_crash_id` (aka `crash_id` in the CRIS extract) |                    |                                |                                                                                               |
| units       | `id`               | (`unit_nbr`, `cris_crash_id`)                        | crashes            | `crash_pk`                     | `crash_pk` set via `units_cris_set_unit_id` [sic] trigger function                            |
| people      | `id`               | (`prsn_nbr`, `unit_nbr`, `cris_crash_id`)            | units              | `unit_id`                      | `unit_id` is set via `people_cris_set_unit_id` trigger function                               |
| charges     | `id`               | (`prsn_nbr`, `unit_nbr`, `cris_crash_id`)            | crashes, people    | `crash_pk`, `person_id`        | `crash_pk` and `person_id` set via `charges_cris_set_person_id_and_crash_pk` trigger function |

#### User-created crash records, aka "temporary" records

Because there can be a lag time of weeks, even months, before law enforcement investigators submit their crash report to TxDOT, the Vision Zero team needs the ability to manually create "temporary" records so that reporting metrics are more timely/accurate.

The VZE makes this possible by allowing users to insert crash, unit, and people records directly into the database. User-created records must be inserted into the `_cris` tables to ensure the proper data flow across the `_edits` and unified tables.

User-created records do not have a `cris_crash_id` column. Because `cris_crash_id` is central to the VZE for searching and navigating to crash pages, we use a generated column, `crashes.record_locator`, as a pseudo-crash ID. The `record_locator` column is generated as either `T<crashes.id>` (for temp records) or `<cris_crash_id>` (for CRIS records), and is rendered throughout the VZE.

#### Audit fields

Audit fields are used through the CRIS record tables and are managed via trigger. Any new tables add to the database should follow the same convention:

- `created_at`: the creation timestamp of the record. Default `now()`.
- `updated_at`: the timestamp of the last record update. Default `now()`, set via trigger on row update.
- `created_by`: the email address of the user who created the record. default `system`.
- `updated_by`: the email address of the user who updated the record. default `system`.

#### Change logs

The database includes an extensive change logging system that captures all edits to any of the nine tables that comprise the crash, unit, and people tables. Change log entries are created via triggers that fire _after_ records are modified, and includes a copy of both the `old` and `new` version of each record as a JSON blob.

Each change log table follows the same structure:

| column_name      | data_type                  | description                                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`             | `integer`                  | Auto-incrementing primary key                                                      |
| `record_id`      | `integer`                  | Foreign key referencing the record's `id` column                                   |
| `operation_type` | `text`                     | The event that triggered the change: `UPDATE` or `INSERT`                          |
| `record_json`    | `jsonb`                    | A JSON blob of the record which contains the `old` and `new` version of the record |
| `created_at`     | `timestamp with time zone` | The timestamp this row was created - default `now()`                               |
| `created_by`     | `text`                     | The user who triggered this change - default `system`                              |

The view `crashes_change_log_view` provides a unioned view of the unified table change logs—this view powers the change log UI in the VZE.

### Austin Fire Department (AFD) and Travis County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (todo)

### Geospatial layers

We have a number of tables which function as geospatial layers which are referenced by crashes and various other records. At the Vision Zero team's request, our team is actively working to expand the number of layers available in the database as well as add new attribute columns to crash records which will be populated based on their intersection with these layers.

| Table                 | Geometry type | description                                                                                               | owner/source                                                         |

## Common maintenance tasks

### Add a new CRIS-managed column to `crashes`, `units`, or `people`

Follow these steps to add a new column to the database that will be sourced from CRIS. See [PR #1546](https://github.com/cityofaustin/vision-zero/pull/1546) as an example.

1. Remember that all database operations should be deployed through migrations. See the [development and deployment](#development-and-deployment) docs.
2. Add the new column to all three tables of the given record type. For example, if this is a crash-level column, add the column to the `crashes_cris`, `crashes_edits`, and `crashes` tables.
3. Modify the trigger function that inserts new rows into the `_edits` and unified table that corresponds to the record type you are modifying: either the `crashes_cris_insert_rows()`, `units_cris_insert_rows()`, ot the `people_cris_insert_rows()` function. Locate the part of the function that selects all values from the new `_cris` record and inserts into the unified table. This should be obvious, because all column names are listed in this function. Add your new column name to function accordingly.
4. Next, you will need to add your new column to the `_column_metadata` table, so that the CRIS import ETL is aware that this column should be included in imports. For example:

```sql
insert into _column_metadata (column_name, record_type, is_imported_from_cris)
values ('drvr_lic_type_id', 'people', true);
```

5. When you're ready to test the trigger behavior, you can enable debug messaging for this trigger by executing the command `set client_min_messages to debug;`. This will cause the trigger debug messages to log to your SQL client.

6. Re-apply Hasura metadata to ensure that your new column is known to the graphql API. You do not need to modify the metadata unless you want to add select, insert, and/or update permissions to this column for non-admin users.

```shell
# ./database
hasura metadata apply
```

7. You are now ready to test your new column using the CRIS import ETL. If you need to backfill this new column for old records, you will need to manually request the necessary CRIS extract zip files so that they can be processed by an ad-hoc run of the CRIS import ETL.

### Add a custom column to `crashes`, `units`, or `people`

Follow these steps to add a custom, non-CRIS column to `crashes`, `units`, or `people`.

1. Remember that all database operations should be deployed through migrations. See the [development and deployment](#development-and-deployment) docs.

2. Add your new column to the `_edits` and unified table for the given record type. For example, if this is a crash-level column, add the column to the `crashes_edits` and `crashes` tables.

3. Unlike adding a CRIS-managed column, you do not need to modify any trigger functions, because the `_edits` trigger functions (`crashes_edits_update`, `units_edits_update`, `people_edits_update`) do not rely on hard-coded column names.

4. Next, add your new column to the `_column_metadata` table and indicate that it should _not_ be imported by CRIS.

```sql
insert into _column_metadata (column_name, record_type, is_imported_from_cris)
values ('vz_custom_column', 'crashes', false);
```

5. When you're ready to test the trigger behavior, you can enable debug messaging for this trigger by executing the command `set client_min_messages to debug;`. This will cause the trigger debug messages to log to your SQL client.

### Adding a computed or generated field to `crashes`, `units`, or `people`

Follow these steps to add a computed or generated field to `crashes`, `units`, or `people`.

1. Remember that all database operations should be deployed through migrations. See the [development and deployment](#development-and-deployment) docs.

2. Computed or generated fields should be added to the unified record table only. For example, if this is a crash-level column, add the column to the `crashes` tables.

3. If your column will be modified by a trigger function or generated column definition, be sure to inspect the table's existing triggers and generated fields and [understand their execution order](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/trigger-definition.html).

4. Lastly, add your new column to the `_column_metadata` table and indicate that it should _not_ be imported by CRIS.

```sql
insert into _column_metadata (column_name, record_type, is_imported_from_cris)
values ('my_generated_column', 'crashes', false);
```

5. When you're ready to test the trigger behavior, you can enable debug messaging for this trigger by executing the command `set client_min_messages to debug;`. This will cause the trigger debug messages to log to your SQL client.

### Refreshing lookup tables with the latest CRIS values

Todo: see the helper script readme.

### Add a custom lookup value to a CRIS-managed lookup table (todo)

### Debugging record triggers

The various record insert and update trigger functions which manage the `_cris` and `_edits` data flows have debugging statements embedded. Debug messaging can be enabled on a per-client-session basis by executing the command `set client_min_messages to debug;` in your SQL client. Your SQL client will now log debug messages when you use it to make record inserts and updates.

### Parsing change log data

This query will help you parse the change log JSON blobs to inspect what changes have occurred. Each row returned is a single column that was updated in a change event. You can replace `crashes_cris` with your table of interest, and you can modify the `where` condition to further filter on a specific record set.

You should always use a `limit` to avoid long-running queries against the change logs.

```sql
WITH diffs AS (
    SELECT
        id AS change_id,
        record_id,
        created_at,
        created_by,
        column_name,
        record_json -> 'old' -> column_name AS old_value,
        record_json -> 'new' -> column_name AS new_value
    FROM
        change_log_crashes_cris,
        LATERAL jsonb_object_keys(record_json -> 'new') AS column_name
    WHERE (record_json -> 'new' -> column_name) IS DISTINCT FROM (record_json -> 'old' -> column_name)
    AND operation_type = 'UPDATE'
ORDER BY
    id DESC
)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    diffs
WHERE
    column_name NOT IN('updated_at', 'created_at', 'cr3_stored_fl', 'cr3_processed_at')
LIMIT 10000;
```

## Backups

Daily database backups are managed via AWS RDS. Backups are retained for 14 Days.

## Hasura

We deployed a standard Hasura container to work as an API between Postgres and the VZE. For more information on how it works, please refer to their [website](https://hasura.io) and documentation.

## Development and deployment

Changes to the schema and database are handled by CI (GitHub Action workflow) that applies migrations and metadata using the [Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/overview/).

### Generating migrations and metadata changes

- Merge the latest code from the `main` branch into your feature branch to make sure you have the latest migrations that are applied to the staging database
- Start up the local database and Hasura engine and replicate using the latest production data dump
- To make sure your local database is up to date with the current changes in `master` branch, run:

```bash
hasura migrate apply --envfile .env.local
hasura metadata apply --envfile .env.local
```

- Start the local Hasura console and make any changes needed which will then reflect in your project folder

### Merging an approved feature branch

We need to check the order of migrations against those in the `main` branch **before merging a feature branch** so that we can make updates to the migration version order if needed. The version refers to the timestamp in the migration folder name.

To check migrations for any conflicts with the latest migrations in the `main` branch:

To check migrations for any conflicts with the latest migrations in the `master` branch:

- Make sure that your branch is up to date with `master`
- Check to make sure no one else is actively merging their work and coordinate if needed
- Update the migration versions in your branch so they are the newest migrations if needed
- Start up the local database and Hasura engine and replicate using the latest production data dump
- Then, run:

```bash
hasura migrate apply --envfile .env.local
hasura metadata apply --envfile .env.local
```

Once we see that no errors occur when applying the sequence of migrations locally, we can merge and the CI will apply the new migrations and metadata to the staging database.
