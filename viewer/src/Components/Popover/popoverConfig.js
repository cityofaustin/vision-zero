            Years of Life Lost is an estimate of the number of additional years
            a person would have lived if they had not died prematurely. For this
            calculation we assume an average life expectancy of 75 years. For
            example, a 25 year old person killed in a crash would represent 50
            years of life lost. The total number represented here reflects all
